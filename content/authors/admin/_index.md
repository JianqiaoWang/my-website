I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Tsinghua University. 

I got my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from  the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor Hongzhe Li. After that, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the Biostatistics Department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, advised by Professor Xihong Lin.

My research is dedicated to developing scalable and robust statistical methods for analyzing the high-dimensional genetic and genomic data.
