I am currently a 5th-Year Ph.D. student at the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. Hongzhe Li.

My research interest lies in understanding the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and disease outcomes. My current research focuses on (i) developing statistical tools for analyzing genetic and genomic data, (ii) detecting and identifying the overlapping genetic architecture.
